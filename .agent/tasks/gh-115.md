## Problem

GitHub Issue #115: Wizard tracks completed steps by index instead of stable ID

## Problem

`completedSteps` in `ScenarioWizard.jsx` stores step indices (e.g., `[0, 1, 2]`), but the `steps` array is dynamic -- the CPU Config step is inserted or removed based on `selectedResources`. When the array changes, indices shift and completion checkmarks can apply to the wrong step.

## Reproduction

1. Select CPU resource (steps become: Resources, Cell Config, CPU Config, Advanced)
2. Advance through all steps via Continue (all get checkmarks)
3. Navigate back to Resources and deselect CPU
4. Steps become: Resources, Cell Config, Advanced
5. Advanced (now index 2) inherits the checkmark from CPU Config (previously index 2)

## Expected Behavior

Completion state should be tracked by stable step ID (e.g., `"resources"`, `"cell-config"`) so toggling the CPU step doesn't corrupt checkmarks.

## Scope

This is a pre-existing issue in the component architecture, not introduced by #114. Both `handleContinue` and `handleStepClick` use the same index-based `markStepComplete`.

## Files

- `frontend/src/components/wizard/ScenarioWizard.jsx` -- `completedSteps` state and `markStepComplete` callback

## Priority

Low -- cosmetic. Completion checkmarks have no effect on form submission or validation logic.

## Acceptance Criteria
