# ABOUTME: Enables legacy peer deps to resolve swagger-ui-react tree-sitter conflicts

# swagger-ui-react has conflicting peer dependencies for tree-sitter:
# - tree-sitter@^0.22.4 (from @swagger-api/apidom-parser-adapter-yaml-1-2)
# - tree-sitter@^0.21.1 (from tree-sitter-json@0.24.8)
# This flag allows npm to resolve these conflicts gracefully.
