# Generating Commit Messages

## Instructions

1. Run `git diff --staged` to see changes
2. I'll suggest a commit message with:
   - Summary under 50 characters
   - Detailed description
   - Affected components

## Best practices

- Follow the conventions on [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
- Use present tense
- Explain what and why, not how
